## Improvenents
This project is based on [Kuuhhl's esp8266Chat](https://github.com/Kuuhhl/esp8266Chat), but has many improvements.

* üì± New, modern, responsive, mobile-friendly, lightweight (1 kb) theme
* üöÄ Performance boost: browser side caching, gzipped files, fewer http request
* üìà Display telemetry datas
* üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Better browswer support (HTML errors fixed)
* üí° Toggleable built in LED blynking
* üìñ Lot of code refactoring
* üìñ Documentation extensions

## Installation (for NodeMCU)
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Kuuhhl/esp8266Chat/releases/) `.bin` files.
2. Download and install [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).
3. Flash the `.bin` files using this command: `esptool.py write_flash 0x0 firmware.bin 0x00300000 littlefs.bin`.

## Usage
1. Connect the esp8266 to a powerbank.
2. Connect to the newly created Wifi-Hotspot `Chat Server`.
3. Open any URL in your browser, it should automatically redirect you. (it doesn't work? try to replace `https://` in your URL with `http://`.)

## Manually building and uploading the project

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PlatformIO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)
2. Clone (download) the repository from Github
3. Open the project with PlatformIO
4. To change theme you have to copy the selected theme minified and gzipped `index.html.gz` file to the `data` folder (the PlatformIO uses this folder to build the file system image for the ESP)
5. Build and upload the code TODO: find the exact button to do this
6. Build and upload the file system image TODO: 

## Minify and compress theme

We do some optimalizations on the website before uploading to the ESP. to make it as small ass possible. This task can be automatized. This can be done with Python (`extra_script.py`) or with Marlin, but it is not working yet, so we need to do mannally.

#### Manual method

1. Minify CSS: [https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier](https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier)
2. Minify JS: [https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier](https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier)
3. Combine HTML CSS, JS into one HTML file
4. Minify the combined HTML [https://www.toptal.com/developers/html-minifier](https://www.toptal.com/developers/html-minifier)
5. Gzip the combined HTML [https://gzip.swimburger.net/](https://gzip.swimburger.net/)

## Endpoints
* `/` default landing page.
* ~~`/styles.css` css styles for the landing page.~~ *- removed, because the CSS merged to one HTML file*
* ~~`/scripts.js` js scripts for the landing page.~~ *- removed, because the JS merged to one HTML file*
* `/sendText` POST endpoint to send a new message. Parameters: `nickname`, `text`.
* `/showText` content of messages.txt file.
* `/lastWrite` timestamp of last write.
* `/clear` clear all messages.
* `/toogleBlynk` toogle led blynking function. Returns the actual state of blynking (`0` or `1`).
* `/getFreeSpace` free space in the eeprom in bytes

## Backlog

* [ ] Use Websocket insted of REST API
* [ ] Automate data minify, gzip, compress, build Filesystem image and upload Filesystem image
* [ ] Improve UI Design to look like Messenger, with animations
* [ ] Tranform the frontend to a PWA
* [ ] Notifications
